# Effect Package Template

This template provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable TypeScript package with Effect. 

## Running Code

This template leverages [tsx](https://tsx.is) to allow execution of TypeScript files via NodeJS as if they were written in plain JavaScript.

To execute a file with `tsx`:

```sh
bun tsx ./path/to/the/file.ts
```

## Operations

**Building**

To build the package:

```sh
bun build
```

**Testing**

To test the package:

```sh
bun test
```
